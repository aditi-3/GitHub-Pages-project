## Introduction

<ins> **Hi, my name is Aditi!** </ins>

## Why Computer Engineering?
What made me choose computer engineering was a coding class I took in high school. I had a very supportive teachter who pushed people to give coding a try. After my first ``` print("Hello World")``` I thought to myself, 
> "This wasn't as bad as I initially thought."

Then, I went on to pursue an internship in bioinformatics, exploring a world that integrated biology and coding (both things I love) into one. Since then, I saw my future career as a path that uses coding for something impactful.

## Other interests
Aside from career outlooks, I also have hobbies I am passionate about..
1. Drawing/painting  
2. Listening to music  
3. Nail art  
4. Working out  

Though I don't have a portfolio of all my artwork, here are some artists I admire the art style of: [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/6966574420251446/).
